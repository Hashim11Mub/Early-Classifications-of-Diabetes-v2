# Problem description

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) research from 2018, diabetes is one of the chronic, life-threatening diseases with the greatest rate of growth, having already afflicted 422 million people globally. For a clinically significant outcome, early identification of diabetes is usually preferred due to the existence of a relatively long asymptomatic period. Due to the long-term asymptomatic phase of diabetes, approximately 50% of those who have it go untreated.

This dataset includes 520 observations with 17 characteristics that were gathered from patients at the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh, utilizing direct surveys and diagnostic findings.

# Objectives

#### • Create a classification model to predict diabetes.
#### • Examine the most prevalent characteristics linked to diabetes risk.
#### • Interpret the results of the analysis and provide recommendations for healthcare providers based on the insights gained.
#### • Perform data pre-processing tasks such as handling missing data, dealing with outliers, and scaling or normalizing the data.

# Hypothesis

Machine learning models can accurately predict the early onset of diabetes based on a combination of demographic, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors, and outperform traditional risk prediction models.
